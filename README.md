# autotyper
This script allows auto typing on programs that don't allow the usage of copy paste.

In order to use this script, it is necessary to have installed:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool)

If using Ubuntu, put the file under the /bin folder on the home directory and grant it execution permission.

To run the script use the following syntax:

	autotyper [-h] "text you want to type" <Number of repetitions> <Interval (s) between repetitions>

You can also run the following command to get help:

	autotyper -h OR --help
