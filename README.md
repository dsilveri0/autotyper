# autotyper
This script autotypes phrases, letter by letter, at a set interval and number of repetitions.

In order to use this script, it is necessary to have installed:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool)

To run the script use the following syntax:

	python3 autotyper [-h] "text you want to type" <Number of repetitions> <Interval (s) between repetitions>

You can also run the following command to get help:

	python3 autotyper -h OR --help

For this program to run, you need to grant it execution permissions.

If you don't want to type python3 everytime you want to run the script, there's methods to make your system recognize the script as a system command thus allowing you to run it without "python3" before it.
